1. The Basics: No Universal Healthcare

The United States is not like other nations such as the UK or Canada, which have a universal healthcare system. That is, individuals are not automatically provided for by the government when they need medical care.

Instead, most individuals use health insurance—either through their work or purchased independently.

There are two big public programs:

Medicare – for individuals over 65 or with specific disabilities

Medicaid – for individuals with extremely low income


The others are largely insured through private companies.

2. Healthcare is Too Costly

One of the largest problems in America is cost.

The U.S. spends more money on healthcare per individual than any nation—over $13,000 annually per person. And yet, millions of individuals cannot even afford treatment.

For instance:

A basic doctor's visit could run $100 to $300

A trip in an ambulance may cost $500 or more

A hospital stay could cost thousands of dollars, even with insurance

This is much different in India, where simple care is often cheap or even free in government hospitals.

3. The Role of Insurance

In the United States, if you lack insurance, you may forgo treatment or even skip hospitals because of the expense.

Health insurance assists in paying for:

Doctor visits

Hospital stays

Surgeries

Medicines


But even with insurance, individuals tend to shell out deductibles, copays, and monthly premium payments. These are out-of-pocket expenses that add up fast.

So knowing your insurance plan is crucial in the U.S.

The U.S. healthcare system is robust but complex

It provides quality care for those who can pay for it

But access and cost are still serious concerns

Insurance is at the center of being treated
